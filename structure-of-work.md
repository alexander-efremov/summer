## Tracking Work

You acknowledge and agree that:

1. **Work is tracked _exclusively_ on GitHub issues**;
+ Each task should have its own GitHub issue and be clearly related to a _component_ of the **dwyl app**;
+ If you discuss something related to a story/feature/task _verbally_, always ensure it is captured in a comment in the GitHub issue for posterity; we favour full transparency and as much detail/context as possible in the issue is always better;
+ Tasks _**must**_ **be _estimated_** (_in minutes - not "points" - by everyone present and an **average recorded** as the estimate_) **_before_ being _started_**;
+ _**Always**_ track your time while you are _doing_ the task. Failure to track your time, will result in _forfeit_ of payment (_see below_).
+ _**Always**_ include the **link to** the **GitHub issue** in the **commit messages** to _ensure traceability_ and to simplify code review;
+ Your work (on a story/feature/task) is _**not**_ "_**done**_" _until_ it meets the _**definition of done**_ (_see below_).


## Definition of "_Done_"
We will keep adding detail to this as we gain understanding of any ambiguities that may arise.

For clarity, a task will not be considered to be complete until all these items can be checked off.
- [ ] Time to be taken for the task was estimated and agreed by all present
- [ ] Actual time taken for the task was recorded
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] 100% test coverage
- [ ] Code updates come with a corresponding update to the documentation
- [ ] Front end features should be user-tested and notes should exist on this testing
- [ ] Code should always be peer reviewed (if a bug is introduced, it will first be raised to the person who carried out the peer review/QA)

_Require actions:_
- [ ] Code follows the dwyl styleguide [must be officially created https://github.com/dwyl/summer-2015/issues/22]
- [ ] Video walkthrough of using the feature/fundtionality created [example needs to be created]


> TBD: https://github.com/dwyl/start-here/issues/33
