## Tracking Work

You acknowledge and agree that:

1. **Work is tracked _exclusively_ on GitHub issues**;
+ Each task should have its own GitHub issue and be clearly related to a _component_ of the **dwyl app**;
+ If you discuss something related to a story/feature/task _verbally_, always ensure it is captured in a comment in the GitHub issue for posterity; we favour full transparency and as much detail/context as possible in the issue is always better;
+ Tasks _**must**_ **be _estimated_** (_in minutes - not "points" - by everyone present and an **average recorded** as the estimate_) **_before_ being _started_**;
+ _**Always**_ track your time while you are _doing_ the task. Failure to track your time, will result in _forfeit_ of payment (_see below_).
+ _**Always**_ include the **link to** the **GitHub issue** in the **commit messages** to _ensure traceability_ and to simplify code review;
+ Your work (on a story/feature/task) is _**not**_ "_**done**_" _until_ it meets the _**definition of done**_ (_see below_).


## Definition of "_Done_"
