#dwyl Freelance Agreement

![sunrise](http://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5194/14214959202_fa7893b6c3_k.jpg)

You are hereby _invited_ to _join us_ as a _**freelance contributor**_ of _**dwyl**_  - the app that helps you _**do what you love**_!

This agreement has been crafted to **_clarify_ the intellectual property questions** that we have been asked by potential contributors to the project(s).
_**In short**: What you contribute is **your own work**. You can still **keep using it for anything** you like and once it's part of dwyl's repositories, **so can we**. Remember also that this is **open source so other people can too!**_

This is both a _social and market contract_.

##Why have this agreement?

This agreement is for your peace of mind as a contributor (we want to make sure you have no doubts about what will happen to your contribution) as well as for the protection of **dwyl ltd**. and others using _**the codebase**_.

We **_request_ that you _either_ physically or electronically _sign_ (a _printed or digital_ version respectively of) this agreement** and return it to **dwyl ltd.** before committing any code to the project.

## What are we agreeing to?

As an individual contributor, you are contributing **_original works_** of code to the open source codebase ("**the codebase**") which forms the "**dwyl app**" and is maintained **dwyl ltd**.

You (**the contributor**) hereby confirm that:

1. The contributions you make to the codebase are **_your original work_**
2. By committing your code into a dwyl-owned repository, **you grant worldwide, and irrevocable but non-exclusive copyright with no further charge **
3. This is an open source project, so in addition to **dwyl ltd**. using your (and all of our) contributions, the codebase may also be used by other people (3rd parties) without further financial consideration.
+ Your contribution **does not grant you a _claim_ to any earnings** (past, present or future) of **dwyl Ltd**. or any other individuals or companies that use your code.
+ You **do not have any _obligation_ to provide support for your code**, however you are encouraged to remain a contributor/supporter for as long you find it personally beneficial;
+ We ask nicely that anyone who uses the dwyl codebase provides **attribution**

We agree to the following:

a. **ensure that you are listed as a contributor** where ever your **original work** has been used.  
b. **You can use your contribution for any other purpose** including other open source projects, provided you communicate clearly with the owners/maintainers of those projects where/when you produced the "**original work**" and email us to that effect.



## Tracking Work

You acknowledge and agree that:

1. **Work is tracked _exclusively_ in GitHub issues**
2. Each task should have its own GitHub issue and be clearly related to a _component_ of the **dwyl app**;
3. Tasks _**must**_ **be _estimated_** (_in minutes - not "points" - by everyone present and an average recorded as the estimate_) **_before_ being _started_**.
4. Once you have completed the task, include the link to the GitHub issue in the commit message to ensure traceability and simplify code review.
