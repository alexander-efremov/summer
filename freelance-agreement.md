Thank you for wanting to be a part of dwyl. Our hope is that you love working here as much as we do and that if you don't, you let us know!

We have put together this agreement to **_clarify_ the intellectual property questions** that we have been asked by potential contributors to our projects.    
_**In short: What you contribute is your own work. You can still keep using it for anything you like and once it's part of our repositories, so can we. Remember also that this is open source so other people can too!**_
 
##Why have this agreement?
This agreement is for your protection as a Contributor (we want to make sure you have no doubts about what will happen to your contribution) as well as for the protection of dwyl Ltd and its users so we **will be asking you for an electronically signed copy of this agreement** (we've found that the vast majority of people are lovely and honest, but occasionally we come across someone who is less so - though we're sure that isn't you!).    
**It does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose**.

##What do we both agree to?
"You" are the contributor, who is contributing code to the open source codebase belonging "us", dwyl Ltd ('dwyl').

We both agree that we understand and have no objections to the following:
1. You of course **have the legal authority to agree to this** set of conditions (because let's face it, otherwise this would be a pointless exercise);
+ The contributions you are making **are your original work** or work that you own the copyright to (no one likes people who take things without attribution or permission);
+ Once your code has been accepted into a dwyl-owned repository, **you are granting us a worldwide, no charge and irrevocable but non-exclusive copyright** to the contribution to do as we wish with that code;
    + We will **ensure that you are listed as a contributor**
    + **You can use your contribution for any other purpose**
+ This is an open source project, so your (and all of our) contributions may also be picked up and used by other people (3rd parties);
+ Your contribution **does not give you a claim on or access to any earnings** (past, present or future) of dwyl Ltd or any other individuals or companies that use your code through dwyl;
+ You **don't have any obligation whatsoever to provide support for your code**, but if you'd like to we'll be all "hooray, you're awesome!";
+ We ask nicely that anyone who uses the dwyl codebase provides **attribution** for the code, but this doesn't always happen and currently we don't police this (we're happy for you to do so if you wish).

##The financials
As one of the select group of paid freelancers working on this project, you're lucky enough to get _another_ section to read through! The dates below apply only to this 'The financials' section of the agreement.

We both agree to the following payment terms and schedule:
+ You will be working with dwyl as a freelance; contractor from **[date x]** to **[date y]** based in Portugal, where accommodation will be provided for you
+ You will work **anywhere up to 6 (six) hours a day** (though you can certainly work more with prior agreement) - we fully expect you to spend the rest of the day relaxing, learning and enjoying your surroundings (and we hope that you'll be doing what you love every day);
+ You will **track your working time** meticulously;
+ We will pay you at the rate of **Â£ X GBP per hour**;
+ You will **invoice us within 7 days** of finishing the work (but preferably asap!) - don't forget to include your bank details :)
+ We will **pay you within 7 days** of receiving your invoice.

##Signatures
