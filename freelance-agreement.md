#dwyl Freelance Agreement

![seedling](http://i.imgur.com/u6xFrZX.jpg)

You are hereby _invited_ to _join us_ as a _**freelance contributor**_ of _**dwyl**_  - the app that helps you _**do what you love**_!

This agreement has been crafted to **_clarify_ the intellectual property questions** that we have been asked by potential contributors to the project(s).
_**In short**: What you contribute is **your own work**. You can still **keep using it for anything** you like and once it's part of dwyl's repositories, **so can we**. Remember that all our code is **open source so other people can use it too!**_


## Why have this agreement?

This agreement is for _your_ peace of mind as a contributor (we want to make sure you have no doubts about what will happen to your contribution) as well as for the protection of **dwyl Ltd** and others using _**the codebase**_.

We **_request_ that you _either_ physically or electronically _sign_ (a _printed or digital_ version respectively of) this agreement** and return it to Inês @**dwyl** before committing any _code_ to the project.

## What are we agreeing to?

As an individual contributor, you are contributing **_original works_** of code to the open source codebase ("**the codebase**") which forms the "**dwyl app**" and is maintained **dwyl ltd**.

As a **contributor**, you hereby confirm that:

1. The contributions you make to the codebase are **_your original work_**
2. By committing your code into a dwyl-owned repository, **you grant worldwide, and irrevocable but non-exclusive copyright with no further consideration**
3. This is an open source project, so in addition to **dwyl ltd**. using your (and all of our) contributions, the codebase may also be used by other people (3rd parties) without further consent or consideration.
+ Your contribution **does not grant you a _claim_ to any earnings** (past, present or future) of **dwyl Ltd**. or any other individuals or companies that use your code.
+ You **do not have any _obligation_ to provide support for your code**, however you are encouraged to remain a contributor/supporter for as long you find it personally beneficial;
+ If you use the original works you contribute to the dwyl codebase in future projects we ask that you provide **attribution** back to the project where you originally made the contribution.

We agree to the following:

a. **ensure that you are listed as a contributor** where ever your **original work** has been used; in addition to the permanent contribution on GitHub we will list you on the dwyl website "about" with a link to your prefered online profile(s). If you prefer to exclude yourself from the list of contributors on the dwyl website, please notify us by raising an issue on: https://github.com/dwyl/dwyl.github.io/issues  
b. **You can use your contribution for any other purpose** including other open source projects, provided you communicate clearly with the owners/maintainers of those projects where/when you produced the "**original work**" and provide **attribution** to that effect.



## Tracking Work

You acknowledge and agree that:

1. **Work is tracked _exclusively_ on GitHub issues**. If you discuss something related to a story/feature/task _verbally_, always ensure it is captured in a comment in the GitHub issue for posterity. (_the person who ends up reviewing the feature/code might not be in the same country as you!_)
2. Each task should have its own GitHub issue and be clearly related to a _component_ of the **dwyl app**;
3. Tasks _**must**_ **be _estimated_** (_in minutes - not "points" - by everyone present and an average recorded as the estimate_) **_before_ being _started_**.
4. _**Always**_ track your time while you are _doing_ the task. Failure to track your time, will result in _forfeit_ of payment (_see below_).
5. _**Always**_ include include the **link to** the **GitHub issue** in the **commit messages** to _ensure traceability_ and simplify code review.
5. Your work (on a story/feature/task) is _**not**_ "_**done**_" _until_ it meets the _**definition of done**_ (_see below_).
