#Summer 2015 Bootcamp Code of Conduct

<img align="right" src="http://social.beefeater.co.uk/assets/family-portrait/img/explanation/mr-happy.png"/>
1. **Be happy.** We're surrounding ourselves with sun, sea/lake, fresh food and awesome code so good vibes are mandatory (read: almost unavoidable).

2. **Be respectful of other people's working hours.** It's an awesome place but we're here to work as well as relax and enjoy the beautiful surroundings. People may be working when you're relaxing and vice versa so keep that in mind!

3. **Be tidy.** Common sense rules apply here - leave things as you find them (or better!).

4. **Keep the noise levels down.** Avoid being super loud, especially during the group's established working hours or after 22h00.

5. **Be human.** Behave like a decent human being, as if someone you respect is always around!

6. **Be curious.** Got a question? Ask people on their breaks. Found the prettiest flower you ever did see? Point it out! Take time to explore, breathe in the fresh air and draw inspiration from your new surroundings.

7. **Fear not, '+1's.** You can do your own thing or work with us all, as long as when you're with us you follow this code. There are lots of ways you can add value to the group if you're interested!

8. **If someone is doing something offensive, hurtful or that is damaging yours (and others') productivity, ask them to stop.** They probably don't even realise, just be nice about it.

9. **If someone asks you nicely to stop doing something, stop.** They're coming from a good place.

10. **We're here to help!** If there's anything you need, just ask!
