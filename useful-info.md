##Lakehouse [11th -24th July]
###Location
The house is situated on the lake formed by the [Barragem da Caniçada](https://www.google.co.uk/maps?q=barragem+da+cani%C3%A7ada&ion=1&espv=2&bav=on.2,or.r_cp.&bvm=bv.96339352,d.bGg&biw=1536&bih=928&dpr=2&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=X&ei=Z5-EVbahK8TW7AbH7KuwCA&ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ), a dam crossing the Cávado River.    
[Here it is on a map](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/41%C2%B039'44.9%22N+8%C2%B011'18.9%22W/@41.6615913,-8.1873262,14z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0d251e5a005f7d79:0xa51e530a1036cba5).

###Dates
The dates are quite tight on this one and the house is really only available for the dates in question. We have to **leave the house in the morning** of Friday 24th, so we don't expect this to be a work day.    
If you want to arrive early or leave late, we recommend that you try banding together and crowding into an [airbnb flat in Porto](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/s/Porto--Portugal) - taking a day out to visit this beautiful city is certainly not a _bad_ thing either!

###Airport transfers
It's a drive, so we've tapped up some friends in the area for _mates rates_ which are better than average but still _money_. These prices **include a stop at the local supermarket for [food shopping](#food-shopping)**.
They are Porto airport <-> the door of our house and **one way**:
* €120 for **up to eight people** (€15 each) - jeep with trailer for luggage and shopping
* €70 for **up to four people** (€17.50 each) - standard car 

It's _possible_ by public transport but will take a few hours, involve various types of transport (tube, train, bus) and won't be particularly easy to navigate (you'll get English speakers in the train stations, but unlikely on buses!).

###Food shopping
The closest full on supermarket (probably the size of 2 Tesco Metros) is a 20 minute drive from the house. You won't find much specialty stuff here (out of the ordinary vegetables, superfoods or a huge organics section are pipe dreams) but all standard supermarket stuff and in-season fruit and vegetables are all available.        
5 minutes drive from the house is a little grocery store with every day essentials.

//TODO Add recommendations - half week shop when you arrive (otherwise we'll have no space in the fridge), then another shop mid-week
