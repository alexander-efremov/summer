##Lakehouse [11th -24th July]
###Location
The house is situated on the lake formed by the [Barragem da Caniçada](https://www.google.co.uk/maps?q=barragem+da+cani%C3%A7ada&ion=1&espv=2&bav=on.2,or.r_cp.&bvm=bv.96339352,d.bGg&biw=1536&bih=928&dpr=2&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=X&ei=Z5-EVbahK8TW7AbH7KuwCA&ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ), a dam crossing the Caldo River.    
[Here it is on a map](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/41%C2%B039'44.9%22N+8%C2%B011'18.9%22W/@41.6615913,-8.1873262,14z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0d251e5a005f7d79:0xa51e530a1036cba5).

###Internet conditions
It's a bit remote, so the internet connection isn't particularly amazing. With so many of us there at the same time, we'll have to make sure that there is **no streaming (music or video) or bittorrenting** so people can work.     
Please sort yourself out with an **offline playlist** before you go!

###Dates
The dates are quite tight on this one and the house is really only available for the dates in question. We have to **leave the house in the morning** of Friday 24th, so we don't expect this to be a work day.    
If you want to arrive early or leave late, we recommend that you try banding together and crowding into an [airbnb flat in Porto](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/s/Porto--Portugal) - taking a day out to visit this beautiful city is certainly not a _bad_ thing either!

###Airport transfers
It's a drive, so we've tapped up some friends in the area for _mates rates_ which are better than average but still _money_. These prices **include a stop at the local supermarket for [food shopping](#food-shopping)**.
They are Porto airport <-> the door of our house and **one way**:
* €120 for **up to eight people** (€15 each) - jeep with trailer for luggage and shopping
* €70 for **up to four people** (€17.50 each) - standard car 

It's _possible_ by public transport but will take a few hours, involve various types of transport (tube, train, bus) and won't be particularly easy to navigate (you'll get English speakers in the train stations, but unlikely on buses!).

###Food shopping
The **closest full on supermarket (probably the size of 2 Tesco Metros) is a 20 minute drive from the house**. You won't find much specialty stuff here (out of the ordinary vegetables, superfoods or a huge organics section are pipe dreams) but all standard supermarket stuff and in-season fruit and vegetables are all available.        
There's a **little grocery store with every day essentials** 5 minutes drive from the house.

**Fresh bread** is brought to the house every morning ([this kind](http://ameadella.com/uploads/products/img_0096.jpg) and [this kind](https://charme-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/items/images/000/000/021/normal/pao2.jpg?1383036053) - and [this on Sundays](http://www.paonaporta.pt/images/pnp_images/paes/rosca.jpg)) - we put in the order for the next day.

We recommend:
+ **Plan ahead a few meals** - we can plan meals together when you arrive but there'll be a supermarket trip to stock up on your way from the airport.
+ **Only buy half a week of fresh groceries** or they won't fit in the fridge!!
  + **Same goes for frozen items**
  + We'll do another shop mid-week once we have a better idea of space and food requirements
  + Remember: **don't buy bread** unless there's some specialty bread you're in love with
+ There's a barbeque, so feel free to include that in the plans (always relatively easy but takes a while to get going)
+ You'll want some **snacks** - swimming makes you hungy!

_**Dinner on the Saturday is on us, so don't worry about the day you arrive!**_


###Recommended clothing
We expect everything to be very casual (we're pretty far from anywhere _fancy_) and you'll probably end up **swimming or in the water pretty much every day**. Remember to bring clothing for [any other activities](#activities) you may want to participate in.

It gets a little colder at night, so you'll want to bring something to throw over the top of what you're wearing. There may be a couple of foggy days!

**Don't forget to bring:**
  + Sun glasses
  + Hats (_preferably_ ***sombreros***)
  + Headphones! (we [respect each other's levels of noise tolerance](./code-of-conduct.md))
  + Flip-flops or sandals (_expect these to get wet_)
  + Comfortable walking shoes
  + A set of closed everyday shoes (in case the weather turns)
  + Old Jeans/trousers (_that you don't mind roughing up_)
  + Swimsuits 
  + A couple of jumpers/cardigans/something to throw over your clothes when it gets cold
  + **Sun Screen** (buy/bring/wear) at all times to avoid nasty burns! (_tip: buy @Airport Boots after security checks to avoid carryon liquid limits_)

###Activities
These will be voted on by the people who join in! 

_Free activities:_
+ Snooker, ping pong and darts at the house
+ Canoeing (we have a couple of canoes at the house)
+ There are some gorgeous little waterfalls with a ton of rocks to climb and we'll try to make it out there at least once for a picnic
+ Quadcopter ("drone") flying (see: https://github.com/dwyl/summer-2015/issues/4)
+ General walking around/jogging/exploring
+ Reading/relaxing (we'll have a little library of tech books on hand)
+ Swimming in the lake
+ All. The. Board Games. (and cards)

_Paid activities:_
+ [These guys](http://www.aguamontanha.com/en/prices) who rent all forms of water sports equipment and also take people out on water skiing/wakeboarding lessons and on tubes/buoys are a short boat ride away 
+ Quad biking
+ Guided forest trail hiking
+ Foosball at the café (where the little grocery store is)
+ Rent a ride into [Braga](http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/may/10/braga-portugal-city-break), the nearest 'proper city' and explore (though there's [even more to see](http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/aug/24/travel-tips-rua-de-miguel-bombarda-porto-morecambe-bay-ibiza) in [Porto](http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/nov/06/travel-portugal-vintage-porto))

There isn't anywhere to 'go out' to at night really apart from a little bar/café in the marina which is only accessible by car and not very exciting!

###Cash
We _recommend_ you _**order online for the best exchange rates**_, but if you forget, use https://www.iceplc.com/ ("click & collect")
+ Visit the page for the airport you are flying out from and print off the "voucher" (_the web page_) - make a note of where the ice counter is in the airport.
+ Take the print out with you and exchange your GBP for EUR at the airport.

_Note: If you have any euros left at the end of your trip, we'll happily buy them back from you._

**Possible spends:**
+ Food for the week(s)
+ Airport transfers
+ Money for [activities](#activities)
