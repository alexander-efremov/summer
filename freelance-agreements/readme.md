#How do I sign the agreement?
We ask that you sign the agreement **digitally** and email it to us. Here's how.

##Choosing the correct agreement to sign
The text of the freelance agreement can be found in the [freelance-agreement.md](https://github.com/dwyl/summer-2015/blob/master/freelance-agreements/freelance-agreement.md) file.

You will also notice that there are a number of **PDFs** in this sub-directory. The only difference between these and `freelance-agreement.md` is that the **_dates_** and **_rate per hour_** in the _Financial Consideration_ section have already been added to the PDFs for your convenience.

Each PDF starts with a date stamp in the format _'YYYYMMDD'_ so please download the appropriate one for the time you'll spend with us and double-check the details are correct.
